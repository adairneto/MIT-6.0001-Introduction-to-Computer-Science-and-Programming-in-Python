## Defensive programming 
Write specifications for functions
Modularize your code, comment everything clearly
Test cases: check conditions on inputs/outputs

**Testing/validation**: compare input/output pairs to specification
**Debugging**: study what was leading up to an error

## Types of Testing
### Unit testing
Validate each piece
Testing each function separately

### Regression testing
Add test for bugs as you find them
Catch reintroduced errors that were previously fixed

### Integration testing
Does overall program work?
Do not rush on this

## Testing Approaches
**Intuition** about natural boundaries of the problem
**Random testing**
**Black box testing**: read the specification and explore possible paths
**Glass box testing**: explore the paths through the code, paying attention to loops and boundary conditions

## Debugging
Be systematic!
Use print statements: at the beggining and end of a function, with parameters
Bisection method: put print halfway in code
Study the code looking for how you got the unexpected result
Look at data, form hypothesis, repeat and use simple test cases

### Logic errors
Think before writing new code
Draw pictures, take a break
Explain the code to:
- Someone else
- A rubber ducky

## Quick summary
Don't:
- Write entire program
- Test entire program
- Debug entire program
- Change code

Do:
- Write a function
- Test the function, debug the function
- Repeat
- Do integrate testing
- Backup code
- Document what worked and what didn't worked

## Exceptions
Handler for exception:
`try:`
`except:`
Have separate except clauses to a particular type of exception
`except ValueError:`
`except ZeroDivisionError:`
`else` block when `try` completes without exceptions
`finally` is always executed after `try`, `else` and `except` even with error, `break`, `continue` or `return`
Used to clean up code

**What to do with exceptions?**
Bad idea: fail silently
If in a function, you can return an "error" value
Flag: stop and signal error condition: `raise Exception("description")`

## Assertions
Used to verify if the assumptions are what it is expected to be
If `assert` is false, the function does not continue
Prevents the program from propragating a bad value
Spot bugs as soon as they happened
Is a supplement to testing
Use to check types, invariants, constraints and violantions
