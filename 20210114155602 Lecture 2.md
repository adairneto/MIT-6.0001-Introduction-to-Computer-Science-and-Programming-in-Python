**Strings**
Def. Type of objects
Sequence of characters
Enclosed in "" or ''
Comma "," in print: Python automatically adds a space
Using commas: they don't need to be strings
Using "+" to concatenate: only strings are allowed

**Input**
input("")
Prints whatever is in the quote and waits for the user response and press  enter
Takes a string

**Branching**
A form of control flow
Condition is always true or false
Code block: always uses identation
*If* condition
Always use a ":" at the end of the condition

## How to make computer repeat tasks?

*While* loop
Loops must be started
Loops must increment the loop counter

Shortcut: *For* loop
`for n in range(5):
	print(n)`
	
*Range* can be defined
`range(start,stop,step)`
Stops at stop-1

*Break* statement: immediately exits the innermost loop

For: know the number of iterations
While: unbounded, counter must be initialized
For can be written as a while loop, but the reciprocal is not true
