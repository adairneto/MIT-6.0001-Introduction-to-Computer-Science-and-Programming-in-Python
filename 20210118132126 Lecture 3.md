## String manipulation
Def. Sequence of case sensitive characters
Can be compared
`len()` gives the lenght of the string
Square brackets "[]" gives the **index**
E.g.  s = "abc", s[0] evaluates to "a", s[-1] evaluates to "c"
**Slicing** using `[start:stop:step]`
Always until stop-1
Are not modifiable
Example in a loop:
`for var in range(s):`
`for index in range(len(s)):`
`for char in s:`
E.g. cube root

## Guess and check algorithms

## Approximate solutions

## Bisection method
Kth guess: $\frac{N}{2^K}=1$
$K = ln(N)$
