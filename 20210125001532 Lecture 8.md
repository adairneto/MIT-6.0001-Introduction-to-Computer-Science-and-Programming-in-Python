## What are objects?
Our basic data

### Properties
Every object has:
1. A type
2. Some **data representation**
3. Some **ways to interact** with the object

### What can we do with objects?
1. Create new with the same type
2. Manipulate them
3. Destroy them

### Objects are a data abstraction
1. Captures an internal representation (through data attributes)
2. Captures an interface for interacting with object (through methods; defines behaviors)
Methods aka procedures/functions
Hides implementation

### Example: Lists
Lists are represented internally as a linked list of cells, using a pointer to the next index (and its memory allocation)
Lists can be manipualted by using its index, append, del, len etc.
Internal representation should only be accessible by who created the object

## How to use OOP

### Why use OOP?
- Bundle data into packages
- Divide-and-conquer development
- Reuse code

### How to implement the class?
What's the difference between creating the class and using an instance of the class?

Creating involves:
- Defining the class name
- Defining the class attriutes

Using involves:
- Creating new instances of objects
- Doing operations on the instances

Example:
```
class Coordinate(object):
	#define attributes here
```
"Object" means that "Coordinate" is a Python object and **inherits** all its attributes
Coordinate is a subclass of object
Object is a superclass of Coordinate

## What are attributes?
Data and procedures that belong to the class
Data as other objects that make up the class
Methods as functions that only ork within the class and establishes how to interact with the object

### How to define attributes?
Using a special method `__init__` to initialize
```
class Coordinate(object):
	def __init__(self, x, y):
		self.x = x
		self.y = y
```
Defines how to create an instance of the object
Self refers to an instance of the class, is a placeholder for any sort of instance

Example:
```
c = Coordinate(3,4)
origin = Coordinate(0,0)
print(c.x)
print(origin.x)
```
Python is going to interpret 'c' as self automatically

### Procedural attributes (Methods)
Uses the **dot notation**
```
def distance(self, other):
	x_diff_sq = (self.x-other.x)**2
	y_diff_sq = (self.y-other.y)**2
	return (x_diff_sq + y_diff_sq)**0.5
```
Uses the **parameter self** to refer to any instance of the object
Methods behave like functions
```
c = Coordinate(3,4)
zero = Coordinate(0,0)
print(c.distance(zero))
```
Calls the method on the object "c"
The last line is equivalent to `print(Coordinate.distance(c, zero))`

### Print representation of an object
Define a `__str__` method for the class to tell Python what to do when using `print`
```
def __str__(self):
	return "<"+str(self.x)+","+str(self.y)+">"
```
Must return a string
`isinstance()` checks if an  object is of the class type

## Special operators
+, -, `==`, <, >, len(), print and others have to be defined
`__add__(self, other)` -> `self + other`
`__eq__(self, other)` -> `self == other`
Etc.
