## Searching algorithm

How to find an item from a collection? Is it implicit or explicit?

### Brute force

- Looks through all elements
- On an unsorted list, the order is $O(len(L))$
- On sorted list, the order is $O(len(L))$

### Bisection method

- List must be sorted
- Using **binary search** (?), order is $O(\log (len(L)))$
- When is it better to do sorting then searching? I.e. SORT + $O(\log(n)) < O(n)$? 

## Sorting algorithm

SORT is never lesser than $O(n)$.

How can we amortize the expense of the cost?

Sort once then do many searches:
$$
\text{SORT} + k \cdot O(\log(n)) < k \cdot O(n)
$$
For large $k$, the SORT becomes irrelevant.

### Permutation sort

```python
def bogo_sort(L):
    while not is_sorted(L):
        random.shuffle(L)
```

Complexity: O(?), can be unbounded

### Bubble sort

Comparing and swapping pairwise.

No more than $n$ times through the list.

```python
def bubble_sort(L):
    swap = False
    while not swap:
        print('bubble sort: ' + str(L))
        swap = True
        for j in range(1, len(L)):
            if L[j-1] > L[j]:
                swap = False
                temp = L[j]
                L[j] = L[j-1]
                L[j-1] = temp
```

Complexity: nested loop, so $O(n^2)$.

### Selection Sort

Find the smallest and swap it with the index 0 element, then do it for the remainder until it is all sorted.

*Proof by induction:*

- In the base case, the prefix is empty and suffix whole list. Invariant true.
- Induction step: move the minimum from suffix to the end of prefix. Given that prefix is true before the move, it will be sorted after append.
- Exiting, prefix is entire list and the suffix is empty. Hence, sorted.

```python
def selection_sort(L):
    suffixSt = 0
    while suffixSt != len(L):
        print('selection sort: ' + str(L))
        for i in range(suffixSt, len(L)):
            if L[i] < L[suffixSt]:
                L[suffixSt], L[i] = L[i], L[suffixSt]
        suffixSt += 1
```

Complexity is $O(n^2)$.

### Merge Sort

- Uses divide-and-conquer
- Split the list until only 1 element (sorted, by definition)
- Then merge such that sublists will be sorted after merge

```python
def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i,j = 0,0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    while (i < len(left)):
        result.append(left[i])
        i += 1
    while (j < len(right)):
        result.append(right[j])
        j += 1
    print('merge: ' + str(left) + '&' + str(right) + ' to ' +str(result))
    return result
```

Complexity is O(len(longer list)), i.e. $O(n)$.

```python
def merge_sort(L):
    print('merge sort: ' + str(L))
    if len(L) < 2:
        return L[:]
    else:
        middle = len(L)//2
        left = merge_sort(L[:middle])
        right = merge_sort(L[middle:])
        return merge(left, right)
```

Order of growth, cutting the problem in half, is $O(\log(n))$.

Complexity is $O(n \log (n))$.

- Computational metaphors: **iteration and recursion**
- **Abstraction** of procedures (a kind of delegation)
- Classes and methods to **organize and modularize** systems
- Different classes of algorithms and their **complexity**

Overview:

- Computational modes of thinking
- Problem-solving through algorithms
- Make the computer do what you want it to do

What computer scientists do?

- Think computationally: abstractions, algorithms and automated execution
- Abstraction
  - Choose the right abstractions
  - Deal with multiple layers of abstractions simultaneously
  - Define the relationships between the abstraction layers
- Automation
  - Think in terms of mechanizing our abstractions
  - Mechanization through precise notation and models
- Algorithms
  - Language for describing automated processes
  - Also allows abstraction of details
  - Language for communicating ideas and processes

Aspects of computational thinking:

- How difficult is a problem? How best can I solve it?
- Think recursively: reformulating a difficult problem into a simpler one (reduction, embedding, transformation, simulation)
