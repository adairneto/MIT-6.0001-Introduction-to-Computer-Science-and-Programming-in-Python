## Recap: Complexity Classes

- O(1) constant running time, code does not depend on size of problem
- O($\log n$) logarithmic, reduce problem in half each time through process
- O(n) linear, simple iterative or recursive programs
- O($n \log n$) log linear, will see next time
- O($n^c$) polynomial, nested loops or recursive calls
- O($c^n$) exponential, multiple recursive calls at each level

Ideally, as close to top as possible

## Complexity Analysis

### Constant running time

Can have loop iff the loop doesn't depend on the input

### Bisection Search

Example of divide and conquer, is complexity $O(\log n)$?

We have, in the worst case, to repeat the call $n$ times until n/(2^k) = 1. I.e. $O(n)$ complexity to copy the list.

Hence, $O(n\log n)$.

Alternative: reducing the copy of the list.

```python
def bisect_search2(L, e):
    def bisect_search_helper(L, e, low, high):
        print('low: ' + str(low) + '; high: ' + str(high))  #added to visualize
        if high == low:
            return L[low] == e
        mid = (low + high)//2
        if L[mid] == e:
            return True
        elif L[mid] > e:
            if low == mid: #nothing left to search
                return False
            else:
                return bisect_search_helper(L, e, low, mid - 1)
        else:
            return bisect_search_helper(L, e, mid + 1, high)
    if len(L) == 0:
        return False
    else:
        return bisect_search_helper(L, e, 0, len(L) - 1)
```

Here we have $O(\log n)$ and  the implementation have an impact in the complexity.

### Linear Complexity

**Iterative Factorial**: depends on number of iterative calls

**Recursive Factorial**: still $O(n)$ because the number of function calls is linear in n, and constant effort to set up call

### Log-linear Complexity

Come back next time...

### Polynomial Complexity

Nested loops or recursive function calls

Most common are quadratic

### Exponential Complexity

Recursive functions where more than one recursive call for each size of problem

E.g. Towers of Hanoi

May consider approximate solutions

#### Recursive relation

Let $t_n$ denote time to solve tower of size n
$$
t_n = 2t_{n-1} + 1 \\
 = 2(2t_{n-2} + 1) + 1 \\
= 4(t_{n-2} + 2 + 1) \\
= 4(2t_{n-3} + 1) + 2 + 1
$$
After $k$ steps:
$$
t_n = 2^k t_{n-k} + 2^{k-1} + \cdots + 4 + 2 + 1  \\
= 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-2} + \cdots + 4 + 2 + 1 \\
= 2^n - 1
$$
Hence, order of growth is $O(2^n)$.

#### Power set 

How to write all power sets from $1$ to $n$?

Assume that we know how to solve to $n-1$.

```python
def genSubsets(L):
    res = []
    if len(L) == 0:
        return [[]] #list of empty list
    smaller = genSubsets(L[:-1]) # all subsets without last element
    extra = L[-1:] # create a list of just last element
    new = []
    for small in smaller:
        new.append(small+extra)  # for all smaller solutions, add one with last element
    return smaller+new  # combine those with last element and those without
```

Order of growth: $O(2^n)$

#### Fibonacci

Iterative code: $O(n)$

Recursive code: $O(2^n)$? The problem gets smaller, the base goes down to the golden ration to the nth power
