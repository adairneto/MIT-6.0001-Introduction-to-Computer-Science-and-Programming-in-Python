# Lecture 5: Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, Cloning
Tags: #algorithms #python #tuples #lists

Two new compound data types:
1. Tuples
2. Lists

## Tuples
Can contain various element types
Are *immutable*
Representation: parentheses "()"
`t = (2,"mit",3)`
`t[1]` evaluates to "mit"
Can be concatenated
`(2,"mit",3) + (5,6)` -> (2,"mit",3,5,6)
`t[1:2]` slices the tuple to `("mit",)` (tuple with on eelement)
`len(t)` evaluates to 3
`t[1]=4` gives an error because tuples cannot be modified
Convenient to swap variables
Can be used to return more than one value from a function
Holds collection of data

## Lists
Objects of any type
Are *mutable* objects
Representation: square brackets "[]"
`L = [2, 'a', 4, [1,2]]`
`len(L)` evaluates to 4
Changing a value:
`L = [2,1,3]`
`L[1] = 5`
`L` will evaluate to `[2,5,3]`

### Operations on lists
**Add**
L.append(element)
`L = [2,1,3]`
`L.append(5)`
`L` will evaluate to `[2,1,3,5]`

**Plus operator**
Mutates a list with L.extended(some_list)
`L1 = [2,1,3]`
`L2 = [4,5,6]`
`L3 = L1+L2`
L3 will give `[2,1,3,4,5,6]` without changing L1 and L2
`L1.extend([0,6]` will mutate L1 to `[2,1,3,0,6]`

**Remove**
`del(L[index])` deletes an element at a specific index
`L.pop()` removes the element at the end of list
`L.remove(element)` looks for the specific element and removes it
If the element occurs multiple times, it only deletes its first occurrence

**Convert lists do strings and back**
`list(s)` returns a list with every character from s
`s.split()` splits a string on a character parameter or on spaces if called without parameter
`''.join(L)` turn a list of characters into a string, can give a character in quotes to add char between every element

**Sort or reverse**
`.sort()` mutates the list
`sorted()` does not mutate the list, must be assigned to a variable
`.reverse()`

## Aliases
Changing one changes the other
Side effect of `.append()`

**Cloning a list**
`chill = cool[:]` creates a list with the same elements, from zero to `len(cool)`
Use when you dont want the side effect 

**Nested lists**
Side effects still possible after mutation

Be cautious of mutating a list as you are iterating over it, avoid it
Clone the list first
