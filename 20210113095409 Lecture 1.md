# Lecture 1: What is Computation?
Tags: #algorithms #python

Goals:
1. Knowledge of concepts
2. Programming skill
3. Problem solving

How to represent knowledge with data structures?
Well organized, modulated, easy to understand code
When an algorithm is better than the other?

Types of knowledge:
- Declarative (statement)
- Imperative (recipe)

What is a recipe?
- Simple steps
- Flow: controls when each step is executed
- When to stop

Architecture:
- Memory
- Control Unit
- Arithmetic Logic Unit
- Input & Output

Programming language as a set of primitive operations
Turing: compute anything using six primitives
Expressions: combinations of primitives

What kind of mistakes can happen?
- Syntactic errors
- Statis semantic errors
- Different meaning than what you expected

What is a program?
- Sequence of definitions (evaluated) and commands (executed in a shell)

Programs manipulate data objects
Objects have a type

Type of objects:
- Scalar (can't be subdivided): int, float, bool, NoneType
- Non-scalar

type() returns the type
`$ type(5) int`

Expressions: combine objects and operators, has a value, which has a type
Syntax: `<object><operator><object>`

Assignment: equal sign "=" (binds the name to the value)
Equal sign is an assignment, not an equation (you don't solve for x)
